zmq_init(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_init - initialise 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*void *zmq_init (int 'io_threads');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_init()_ function initialises a 0MQ 'context'.

The 'io_threads' argument specifies the size of the 0MQ thread pool to handle
I/O operations. If your application is using only the 'inproc' transport for
messaging you may set this to zero, otherwise set it to at least one.

.Thread safety
A 0MQ 'context' is thread safe and may be shared among as many application
threads as necessary, without any additional locking required on the part of
the caller.

This function is deprecated by link:zmq_ctx_new.html[zmq_ctx_new].

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_init()_ function shall return an opaque handle to the initialised
'context' if successful. Otherwise it shall return NULL and set 'errno' to one
of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
An invalid number of 'io_threads' was requested.
