zmq_ctx_shutdown(3)
==================


NAME
----
zmq_ctx_shutdown - shutdown a 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_ctx_shutdown (void '*context');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_ctx_shutdown()_ function shall shutdown the 0MQ context 'context'.

Context shutdown will cause any blocking operations currently in progress on 
sockets open within 'context' to return immediately with an error code of ETERM.
With the exception of _zmq_close()_, any further operations on sockets open within
'context' shall fail with an error code of ETERM.

This function is optional, client code is still required to call the link:zmq_ctx_term.html[zmq_ctx_term]
function to free all resources allocated by zeromq.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_ctx_shutdown()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise
it shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The provided 'context' was invalid.
